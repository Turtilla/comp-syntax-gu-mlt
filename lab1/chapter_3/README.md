### CLARIFICATIONS FOR THIS LAB
I feel like some explanations are in order. Due to the first conllu file for Polish throwing errors not just for me and not just in gfud (though working in the 
visualisation tool), I decided to make another, polish_02.conllu file which works, but still has issues in gfud due to encoding (the solution to my error was to set 
encoding to UTF-8 eng_US, which clearly does not support some of the Polish letters.  
I have also included the POS tagged corpora in .txt files that I used as a basis. Overall the files to be graded in my submission are english.conllu and polish_02.conllu.
